    "prompt": "A cinematic, editorial-style photograph of a grid-like wall composed of subtly pixelated, textured stone tiles. The lighting transitions from a soft, cool cyan at the top to a deep, desaturated teal at the bottom, with gentle ambient highlights and deep contrasting shadows. The atmosphere is moody and overcast, evoking a sense of quiet intensity and resilience. The stone surface shows slight grain and natural imperfections, creating a grounded and enduring feel—no abstract patterns, only real, tangible materials. The composition is straight-on, with intentional framing and breathing space, reflecting a resolute and trustworthy mood.",
